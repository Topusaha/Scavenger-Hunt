## Notes - Challenges

When building the app, I had to read through lots of the documentation on photos,
and MapKit and watch videos to see the different ways they are implimented. I also
coded the to do list from scratch which highlighted some styling/UIKit issues I
had. For exmaple, getting the checkbox image to be marked as completed, using
buttons to activate methods, and navigation controls.
